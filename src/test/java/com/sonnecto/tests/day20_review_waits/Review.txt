    What is iFrame? :
                     It's a page inside a page, basically HTML inside HTML.
    How do you handle iframes?
                     We need to switch to iframe to be able to do any action on any web element inside of it.
    How many ways you know to switch between frames?
        3 ways
        1)Index
        2)Id,name
        3)WebElement

TestBase is the parent of all the tests in our framework, by extending our test cases we can easily handle
before and after methods of our test cases.


Actions review
              Actions class: is used for advanced mouse and keyboard actions.
How to use Actions?
    First create an object of Actions Class.
    Second, we need to pass driver as a parameter.
    Third, we use the object created to reach actions methods.
    Fourth, we need to use perform() method at the end of the statement.

    Methods: action.moveToElement().perform();
             action.doubleClick().perform();

===================================================================================================================

    If you have a WebElement that disappears afet a certain time, we can stop HTML in debug mode:
        How: Inspect page, click on Sources, then click F8 or CTRL+\

    POM: Page Object Model review
         What is POM Design Pattern?
            Basically, we create JAVA classes for each page on our project.
            We are storing useful WebElements(reusable), methods
         How do we implement POM Design?
            Constructor: PageFactory class from Selenium
                Constructor gets 2 parameters: (driver object, this(object of the specific class))

         Advantages:
            -Reusability
            -Easy to maintain
            -Easy to explain to non-technical people
            -Handles StaleElementException(PageFactory does this for us)=

   *** Between POM pages, we can create inheritance relationships.
        If you have a page which is the default(you see it wherever you navigate) page, then you define it
            as parent of other POM pages.

            Homework: Create POM pages for allProducts and Order page.

    Explicitly Wait

    IQ: How do you handle synchronization in Selenium?
        What is synchronization?
            Moving or Working or Operating at the same time.
                In when movies voice and picture do not operate together.

    In Web Automation: Java is fast, web page is slower, we need to handle this synchronization issue
        otherwise our code will break.

    1. Static Wait: Thread.sleep method from Java
    2. Dynamic Wait:
                    *Implicit Wait (applies to all elements, we only need to define it one time)
                    *Explicit Wait
                                  Can be used to wait until Certain conditions.
                                    -Wait until element is visible
                                    -Wait until element is clickable
                    Does not depend on the wait time of Implicit wait.
                        Only applies one time. It depends on the condition you give.
