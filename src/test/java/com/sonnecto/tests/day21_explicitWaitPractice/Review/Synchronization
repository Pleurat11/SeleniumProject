    How do you handle synchronization issues in Selenium?
        I use either implicit wait or explicit wait when it comes to synchronization.

        Implicit wait:
                      Waits until element is found in the HTML(DOM).
        We type the implicit wait method once and it applies to all
        the elements we find.

        driver.manage.timeouts.implicitlyWait(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

        Above command affects the findElement(s) methods.
            It will make sure that Selenium waits for the element to appear up to 10 seconds.
                If element appears in 2 secs, it will not keep waiting.
                    If element does not appear in 10 secs, it will throw NoSuchElementException.
-------------------------------------------

    What if I want to wait for certain condition of particular webElement? like button is enabled, link clickable ...

        In those cases we use EXPLICIT wait.
        This wait has many useful conditional waiting commands.

    What was your challenge in your project?

        My application uses many AJAX calls, and I kept getting different exceptions.
            So I used explicit wait to handle the synchronization issues.
                AJAX -> Asynchronous Javascript and XML
            Your page does not refresh completely.
                It only reloads partially. Only certain section of the page reloads.
            So selenium needs to wait until certain element is visible or enabled etc.

==================================================================================================

    Also sometimes elements are hidden but they are in the HTML
        So findElement method will be able to locate them, but we can wait for
            any other actions like click, sendKeys
--------------------------
    Explicit wait:
        1)WebDriver wait class object and pass a driver and time out seconds to constructor.

        2)We need to use ExpextedConditions class method for webelement or whole page.
===================================================================================================

    Thread.sleep(1000); -> hardcoded wait time, comes with java. Should be avoided as much as possible.
                           It does not have any conditions and slows down execution of the app.
=====================================================================================================

    Difference between implicit wait and explicit wait?
        Implicit wait -> time is set once globally and applies to all steps.
                         Works with findElement method and waits until element is present in HTML/DOM(DocumentObjectModel).
                         Stops waiting as soon as element is found in HTML.
                         Will throw NoSuchElementException if element does not appear in HTML during the timeout.

        Explicit wait -> is applied to a specific element on the page.
                         Can be applied with different conditions that are available in ExpectedConditions class.
                         Stops waiting when a certain condition is met.
                         Throws TimeOutException if condition is not met within the specified given time.
  ========================================================================================================================

    WebDriverWait class is used for Explicit wait in Selenium.
        We specify our driver object and timeout seconds in constructor.

    wait.until() -> method is used to wait until certain condition becomes true.

    visibiltyOfElementLocated() -> this method accepts a By locator and waits until it's visible.

    textToBe()-> accepts(By.locator, expectedText)
