Maven LifeCycle
    Mvn clean test -> we used this command to run all the tests.

    Maven is a build tool. It is the most popular build tool.

    Build -> when we create a project and write application code.
             In order to make it available for other apps to use, it needs
                to be deployed and running in server.
                    Ex : When we go to google.com, it will go to google page.
                         It means google app was deployed to server and we as users can access it.

    To reach the deployment level, the project needs to go through a number of steps.
    Those steps are done using maven, and they are called maven life cycle.

        validate-> it validates the project that has no errors.
        compile -> compiles java classes.
        test-> runs all the tests in the package.
        package-> will run all the tests and also create a JAR file for your project.
                   Using that JAR file your maven project can be deployed and shared in mvnrepository.
        install-> it makes sure all dependencies are downloaded and also creates a jar file for your project.

        clean-> delete the target folder in the project.
                At work when I get my project, I always run:
                    mvn clean install -U
                        -U -> forcefully checks each dependency
                    the above command will first delete the target folder.
                        checks each dependency.
                        compiles every java class.
                        runs all tests.
                        creates a jar file for your project.
                    Jar is like a zip file, it contains all our classes and packages in same jar file
                    Java Archive File.

    mvn clean install -U
        click ENTER
            if mvn is not recognized error appears.
                CTRL+ENTER fixes this issue.
        To stop the tets : CTRL+Q

    How do you run automated tests using maven?

    I use mvn clean test to run the tests

    mvn clean install -U -> can be used to run all maven lifecycle steps.
