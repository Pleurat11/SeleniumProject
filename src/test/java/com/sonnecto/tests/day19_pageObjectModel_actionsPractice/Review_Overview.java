    When do we use actions class in Selenium?
        ->We use actions class to perform advanced mouse and keyboard actions
            like hover, double click, right click, drag and drop etc.
         Or sending keyboard clicks like arrow up or down, enter, control etc.

         Syntax:
                Create Actions class object
                Call the method by ending with perform() or build().perform();


    Drag and Drop using Actions class.

        dragAndDrop(sourceElem, targetElem) -> this method accepts 2 webelements
            it will drag sourceElem and drop onto targetElem.

        dragAndDropBy(sourceElem, x, y) -> this method accepts 1 element that will
            be dragged and dropped onto X and Y coordinates on the browser.
            It is useful especially when doing sliders automation.
