    FindElements in Selenium:

    This method locates and returns one or more elements as a List.
    It will find all matching elements to the locator and return them as a List of WebElement objects.

    We need findElements method when working with multiple elements on the page like:
    count, multiple images, links and then we loop through them or check the count.


    <a href = "https://www.google.com"> Google </a>
    <input type="text">
    <input type="submit">

    Let's say I want to find count of elements with input tag:

    List<WebElement> elements = driver.findElements(By.tagName("input"));
